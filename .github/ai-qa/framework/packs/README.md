# Framework pack catalogue

`qa-configure` selects packs per test path after inspecting the actual runner, the dependencies and representative tests. It renders `instructions.template.md` to `.github/instructions/qa-<pack>.instructions.md`, with `applyTo` set to discovered paths only. Never edit packs to configure a project. Project conventions take precedence over pack guidance.

If no pack matches, AI-QA uses the existing project tests and warns that confidence is reduced. If no framework exists, it reports ∅, records ★ and offers a gated scaffold. A full-tier pack provides actionable generation guidance. It doesn't mean dependencies are installed or that generated tests pass.
