# Provider operations contract

This is a documentation contract for provider recipes, not an installed client API. Skills request named operations; provider, deployment and transport are selected from `.github/ai-qa/project/conventions/integrations.md`. Read project settings from `.github/ai-qa/project/project.md` and applicable conventions; only `qa-configure` writes the project layer. A provider recipe never bypasses the L0-L5 rules in `.github/ai-qa/framework/method/safety.md`.

Provider files (`jira.md`, `confluence.md`, `azure-devops.md`, `azure-wiki.md`, `github.md`) are **transport recipes, not executable connectors**. No recipe claims that an MCP tool is installed, that credentials are configured, or that a remote call has succeeded. Every recipe is **unverified** until the configured transport is authorised and a real read-back succeeds. On 401/403/404 report the actual failure rather than a nonexistent item, and retry 429/5xx with bounded back-off for reads only; never blindly retry a non-idempotent write.

## Deployment identification

For Atlassian, `*.atlassian.net` suggests Cloud (**◐ Inferred**); a self-hosted/custom URL suggests Server/DC (**◐ Inferred**). Record the basis and sample URL without credentials. Confirm with an approved read-only `serverInfo` `deploymentType` probe or the configured Atlassian MCP server's deployment metadata. If neither can confirm it, ask once which deployment is configured; do not guess an edition or try a different host. For other providers, use the deployment recorded in `conventions/integrations.md`; an URL alone does not prove access or capability.

## Transport matrix

`✓` supported transport in the v1 matrix; `—` not a listed transport. Support is not proof that a tool, CLI, credential or permission is available in this workspace. `◐` means inferred, not verified.

## Operation contract

All reads are scoped and bounded. Return every required field or an explicit `unknown`/`unsupported`; never infer missing data. Provider-native field names must be normalised to these names.

| Level | Operation | Required inputs | Required returned fields |
|---|---|---|---|
| L0 | `workitem.get` | provider, deployment, `resource_id` (issue key/work-item ID), confirmed scope | `title`, `description`, `acceptance_criteria` (ACs), `type`, `status`, `links`, `comments`, `updated` (last-modified timestamp); missing values are `unknown` |
| L0 | `workitem.search` | provider, deployment, scoped query (JQL/WIQL/provider query), finite `page_size`, optional cursor | canonical work-item IDs, titles, status, continuation or `none`, partial/completeness indicator |
| L0 | `docs.search` | provider, deployment, confirmed space/wiki, scoped query, finite `page_size`, optional cursor | canonical page IDs, titles, paths/URLs, continuation or `none`, partial/completeness indicator |
| L0 | `docs.get` | provider, deployment, page ID/path and scope | actual body and `body_format`, title, parent/space/wiki, version/ETag, canonical URL |
| L0 | `repo.pr.list` | provider, repository, state/filter, finite `page_size`, optional cursor | PR ID/number, title, head, base, status/draft state, URL, continuation/completeness |
| L0 | `ci.runs` | provider, repository/project, pipeline/workflow ID, bounded query and page size | run IDs, timestamps, state/result, URL where available, continuation/completeness |
| L0 | `ci.run.get` | provider, repository/project, run ID | run/commit/ref, state, conclusion, URL, timestamps, relevant jobs |
| L0 | `ci.test-results` | provider, repository/project, run ID | provider-supported test counts, failures, report/artifact URLs, completeness; `unsupported` if not exposed |
| L4 | `workitem.comment` | provider, deployment, work-item ID, exact approved body and target | actual comment ID/URL and read-back result |
| L4 | `workitem.create` | provider, deployment, project/type, confirmed required fields, exact approved title/body | actual work-item ID/URL and read-back result |
| L4 | `docs.publish` (`create`) | provider, deployment, space/wiki/parent/path, exact approved title/body/format | actual page ID/version/URL and read-back result |
| L4 | `docs.publish` (`update` or `append`) | same, plus page ID, fresh source version/ETag and expected version | actual page ID/new version/URL and read-back result |
| L4 | `repo.pr.create` | provider, repository, existing head/base, reviewed diff, exact approved title/body | actual PR ID/URL/head/base/draft state and read-back result |

`ci.test-results` is not inferred from a green build: if detailed results are unavailable, report `unknown` or `unsupported`.

## Request fields

| Field | Required | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `provider` | Yes | `jira`, `confluence`, `azure-devops`, `azure-wiki` or `github` |
| `deployment` | Yes | `cloud`, `server-dc`, `services`, `server`, or `github.com/enterprise` as appropriate; `unknown` blocks remote operations |
| `operation` | Yes | one exact named operation in the catalog; `docs.publish` also requires `mode` |
| `transport` | Yes | approved `mcp`, `cli`, `rest` or `manual`; record tool/command capability, not credentials |
| `base_url` | For REST/CLI | confirmed organization/tenant/collection/repository URL without credentials |
| `scope` | For scoped reads/writes | project/space/repository/wiki/pipeline and permitted environment |
| `resource_id` | For item/page/run-specific operations | provider-native key/ID/path; never fabricated |
| `query`, `page_size`, `cursor` | For search/list | bounded scoped query, finite page size and edition-specific continuation |
| `title`, `body`, `body_format`, `fields` | For L4 writes | human-reviewed provider-native content and discovered fields |
| `mode`, `expected_version` | `docs.publish` | `create`, `update` or `append`; version/ETag required for update/append |
| `head`, `base` | `repo.pr.create` | existing confirmed branches; no implicit branch creation |
| `approval` | For L4 writes | explicit user approval specifying destination and side effect |

Use approved secret storage for authentication and never include credential values in requests, output, generated Markdown or shell history. Encode untrusted path/query components with the transport's URI encoder, validate a trusted HTTPS base URL, and respect the edition's content representation. Never execute a command printed in these recipes without confirming destination, auth scope and action.

## Result fields

| Field | Required | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `provider`, `deployment`, `operation`, `transport` | Yes | The selected and actually used route |
| `status` | Yes | `verified`, `unverified`, `blocked`, `unsupported` or `failed` |
| `canonical_id`, `url` | If known | Actual provider response identifiers; never invent on manual fallback |
| `title`, `description`, `acceptance_criteria`, `type`, `status`, `links`, `comments`, `updated` | `workitem.get` | Observed fields; explicit `unknown` if absent or access-limited |
| `body_format`, `source_version`, `mode` | When relevant | Actual representation and revision/ETag; publish mode |
| `observed_at` | Yes | UTC time of actual observation, not draft generation |
| `evidence` | Yes | redacted tool/endpoint, HTTP status, actual nonsecret response identifier and read-back outcome, or reason unavailable |
| `next_page` | For paginated reads | Provider continuation token/link, or explicit `none` after the final page |
| `warnings` | Yes | Permission, fidelity, conversion, conflicts, partial data or unverified side effects |

**Status rules:** `verified` means an authorized read observed the claimed state (for writes, re-read *after* the write and compare content/version/attachments); a locally drafted page, 2xx write response, returned ID or illustrative endpoint is still `unverified`. `blocked` means required approval/access/environment is missing; `unsupported` means this edition/tool cannot perform the operation; `failed` means an attempted authorized operation returned an error. Never translate 403 to a nonexistent item. Include only non-sensitive evidence and restrict private-content dissemination.

## Execution and manual fallback

1. Read `conventions/integrations.md` for the capability's provider, deployment, base URL, identifiers, preferred-to-fallback transports, authentication method and environment-variable names. Verify the transport is actually available and authorised.
2. Use the configured preferred transport. MCP tool-name hints in provider files are discovery hints only: verify names and supported inputs against available tools. CLI commands require an already-installed, authenticated CLI. REST is a recipe, not a client. Do not install dependencies or write `.vscode/mcp.json` here.
3. If the preferred transport fails, report which transport failed and why, then offer the next configured fallback. Do not silently switch tenant, deployment, auth scope or operation. Never blindly retry a non-idempotent write. A second transport for a write requires the same still-valid exact L4 approval; if target/payload changes, show it and ask again.
4. If no approved transport works, use Manual: ask the user to paste source material or search results for reads; provide paste-ready provider-format content and destination instructions for writes. Write the handoff only to `qa-work/<work-id>/outputs/` after local L1 conditions are met. Label it `unverified / not published` (or `not created`); do not claim a remote ID or URL.

For L4, show action, target, exact payload and side effect, then wait for explicit affirmative approval immediately before acting. After a write, read the result back; a 2xx response or returned ID alone is not verification. Report actual ID/URL and verification status, then log approval/action/result in `qa-work/<work-id>/index.md`. Other external writes such as pipeline triggers or uploads require their own L4 approval and are outside this operation catalog.

## Provenance

Confluence Server/DC read/update/append and conversion facts, and Jira Server/DC issue and comment behaviour, derive from `sylwia-luczak/AI-QA-AGENT_GENERIC` at `ac750bb` (`tools/confluence_tool.py`, `tools/jira_tool.py` and the scenario-format guidance). That source declares no licence, so these files paraphrase behaviour and import no code. Other deployment and API examples remain **unverified** against any live tenant.
