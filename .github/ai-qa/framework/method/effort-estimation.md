# Effort Estimation Reference

Quick reference for estimating testing effort for different ticket types.

## Unit Tests

### Quick (1–2 hours)
- Simple validation functions
- Single-method tests with fixtures
- 5–10 test cases per function
- Example: Certificate field validation, date parsing

### Medium (2–4 hours)
- Multiple related functions
- Mock setup required (certificates, API responses)
- Edge cases and error scenarios
- 15–25 test cases
- Example: Certificate chain validation, OAuth token parsing

## Integration Tests

### Quick (2–4 hours)
- Single workflow file validation
- CI workflow syntax checks
- Simple environment variable validation
- 5–10 test cases
- Example: CI workflow triggers on PR, workflow syntax valid

### Medium (4–8 hours)
- Multi-step CI/CD validation
- Tool integration (test runner, coverage, linting)
- Build success/failure scenarios
- Credential retrieval (mocked)
- 15–30 test cases
- Example: Full CI pipeline, quality-gate integration

### High (8–12 hours)
- Complex pipeline orchestration
- Multiple environment configurations
- Advanced mocking/stubbing
- Deployment dry-runs
- 30+ test cases
- Example: Multi-environment deployment pipeline, infrastructure-as-code validation

## E2E Tests

### Medium (6–10 hours)
- Single external system integration
- API endpoint testing
- OAuth flow (with test provider)
- Basic security validation
- 10–20 test cases
- Example: API gateway deployment, single WAF rule test, request routing

### High (12–20 hours)
- Multiple external systems
- Complex workflows (proxy + auth + backend)
- Security testing (multiple rules, malicious payloads)
- Full deployment verification
- 20–50 test cases
- Example: Full gateway deployment + authentication + a core API endpoint, comprehensive security testing

### Very High (20+ hours)
- Full system integration
- Multi-provider tests (OAuth + certificate + multiple APIs)
- Load testing or performance validation
- Multiple environment rollout
- 50+ test cases

## Effort Factors

### Reduces Effort (-1-2 hours)
- Existing test framework/fixtures
- Mock/stub libraries available
- Clear AC acceptance criteria
- Previous similar tests in codebase
- Test environment pre-provisioned

### Increases Effort (+1-3 hours)
- Need to build custom mocks
- External service test access unavailable
- Credentials/secrets setup required
- Flaky/unreliable test environment
- Complex data preparation
- Multiple dependent tickets

### Significant Blockers (+4-8 hours or Makes Automated Testing Impossible)
- No test environment available
- External partner integration (limited test access)
- One-time infrastructure setup (not repeatable)
- Manual approval required between steps
- Non-deterministic behaviour (race conditions, timing-dependent)

## Ticket Type Patterns

### Infrastructure/Deployment Tickets
- **Usually**: Integration or E2E
- **Example**: "Deploy to the API gateway", "Configure WAF"
- **Typical effort**: 8-15 hours
- **Risk**: Often requires actual environment; may need manual validation first

### Validation/Certificate Tickets
- **Usually**: Unit
- **Example**: "Validate certificates", "Cover validation"
- **Typical effort**: 2-4 hours
- **Risk**: Low; testable in isolation

### CI/CD/Pipeline Tickets
- **Usually**: Integration
- **Example**: "Implement CI workflow", "quality-tool integration"
- **Typical effort**: 4-8 hours
- **Risk**: Medium; depends on the workflow test harness

### API/Proxy Tickets
- **Usually**: E2E
- **Example**: "Deploy proxy", "Call API via gateway"
- **Typical effort**: 10-20 hours
- **Risk**: High; requires multiple external systems

### Tools/Utilities Tickets
- **Usually**: Unit
- **Example**: Create a QA utility or analysis tool
- **Typical effort**: 3-6 hours
- **Risk**: Low; testable with mocks/fixtures

## Estimation Rules of Thumb

1. **Unit tests**: ~0.5–1 hour per function, +1–2 hours for setup
2. **Integration tests**: ~1–2 hours per integration point, +2–4 hours for mocking
3. **E2E tests**: ~2–3 hours per external system, +3–5 hours for environment setup
4. **Infrastructure tests**: ~4–6 hours minimum (manual validation often required first)

## Example Ticket Analysis

### Example Unit Ticket
- 1 component (e.g., a validator or parser)
- 4 test areas (happy path, edge cases, boundary values, error handling)
- ~15-20 test cases
- Mocking: Simple (mock dependencies or use test data)
- **Estimated: 2-3 hours**

### Example Integration Ticket
- 1 workflow (e.g., a CI step or service interaction)
- 4–5 test scenarios (trigger, pass, fail, error path)
- ~10-15 test cases
- Mocking: Medium (mock events or external services)
- **Estimated: 4-6 hours**

### Example E2E Ticket
- 3 systems (e.g., API gateway, auth provider, backend service)
- 5–6 test scenarios (auth, routing, data flow, error handling)
- ~15-25 test cases
- Mocking: Low (need real systems for full E2E)
- Setup: Medium (credentials, environment configuration)
- **Estimated: 12-16 hours**

These estimates assume:
- Developer has basic familiarity with the project's testing tools
- Test infrastructure is available
- Environments are pre-provisioned
- Acceptance criteria are clear

Adjust up to +50% if this is the first time with the technology stack.
